## Explain in a very simple way what you'd like your project to do.

A simple in-browser game (format TBD) which generates NFTs on an EVM compatible chain (or ETH testnet) for achievements or rewards. The idea is for a very basic in-metaverse social proof of work/skill to develop with the ability for these NFTs to be the basis for additional value in or out of game.

## Walk through a single workflow for the future user of your project.
A user will go through the following process:
1. Log into front-end via metamask to access
2. Play the game
3. If they fail before the final level, the user does NOT earn the NFT
4. If they complete the final level, the user earns an NFT, but only if the address that's authenticated has not earned it before
5. Ideas for managing minting costs: ETH L2 (Arbitrum, Optimism, sidechains like Polygon), deferred minting costs etc.
